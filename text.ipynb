    "text = \"Dear ABC Electronics Customer Support, I hope this message finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am the Purchasing Manager at Tech Innovators Inc. I am writing to inquire about the specifications of one of your products. Recently, I came across the ABC UltraSlim Laptop on your website, and it has caught my interest. However, I couldn't find detailed information regarding its technical specifications and compatibility with other devices. Specifically, I would like to know about the exact dimensions and weight of the product, the materials used in its construction, and any certifications or compliance standards it meets. Additionally, I am interested in understanding the warranty and support services provided for this product. Moreover, our company is considering outfitting all our offices with this laptop, so we are also interested in bulk purchase options and any discounts available for large orders. If possible, could you also provide a quote for an order of 50 units? Lastly, I would like to schedule a demonstration of the product to better understand its functionality and features. Please let me know your availability for the same. Thank you very much for your time and assistance. I look forward to your prompt response. Best regards, John Smith, Purchasing Manager, Tech Innovators Inc., john.smith@techinnovators.com, (555) 123-4567\""
